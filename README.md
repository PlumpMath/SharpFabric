# SharpFabric  *****
Uses CefSharp to run fabric.js inside a WPF app.

After downloading need to go to Solution | ConfigurationManager and choose x64 target. (or x86 - just not ANY).
Then go to Solution | Enable automatic nuget restore.
Then should build and run.
Note WPF ui designer doesn't work with cefsharp, and will show an error.
